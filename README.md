# My Feelings Tracker

Simple Android app to track daily emotions through Plutchik's wheel of emotions.

## Overview

My Feelings Tracker is an Android application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** that helps users track and understand their emotional patterns. The app uses Plutchik's wheel of emotions as a framework for categorizing feelings.

## Features

### Current (Foundation)
- Modern Material 3 design with Jetpack Compose
- Local Room database with Plutchik's emotion model (8 categories × 3 intensities)
- Reactive UI with Kotlin Flow and StateFlow
- Localization support (English and Russian)
- Auto backup configuration for data safety
- Testing infrastructure (unit and instrumented tests)
- Notification permissions and boot receiver setup

### Planned
- Quick 2-tap emotion logging
- Calendar view for reviewing past emotions
- Chronological history list
- Settings (display, alarms, data management)
- Daily reminders with WorkManager
- Export/import data (CSV and PDF)
- Multiple color schemes

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3 + Navigation
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) + Repository pattern
- **Database**: Room (SQLite) with TypeConverters
- **Async**: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- **Image Loading**: Coil for Compose
- **Background Tasks**: WorkManager
- **Preferences**: DataStore
- **Testing**: JUnit, Truth, Compose UI Test, Espresso
- **Build**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL + Version Catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)

## Architecture

The app follows the official Android architecture guidelines with a clean, layered structure:

- **UI Layer**: ViewModels + Composables organized by feature
- **Data Layer**: Repository pattern + Room database + DataStore

## About Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions

The app is based on Robert Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotions, which organizes emotions into eight primary emotion categories, each with three intensity levels:

**The 8 Primary Emotions (with intensity levels):**
- **Joy**: Serenity → Joy → Ecstasy
- **Sadness**: Pensiveness → Sadness → Grief
- **Anger**: Annoyance → Anger → Rage
- **Fear**: Apprehension → Fear → Terror
- **Trust**: Acceptance → Trust → Admiration
- **Disgust**: Boredom → Disgust → Loathing
- **Anticipation**: Interest → Anticipation → Vigilance
- **Surprise**: Distraction → Surprise → Amazement

This creates **24 distinct emotional states** (8 categories × 3 intensities) that provide a scientifically grounded framework for emotional tracking and self-awareness.

For detailed information about the theory and its applications, see [docs/Project Overview.md](docs/Project%20Overview.md).
